Greystones North Beach is mostly shingle, backed by quickly eroding mud cliffs. The beach inside the harbour is the easiest embarkation point for kayaks, at any point of the tide. Close nearby is a chip shop, ice cream, pub, and all small modern town facilities. The walk on the shore above the cliffs along here up Bray Head is lovely, as is the walking southwards along the shore. The harbour environment has been the subject of massive development since about 2006.  It is not clear whether the apartment complex / marina that were to accompany the harbour walls reconstruction will ever be finished.  It is a work in progress, or as the case may be.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The East Coast**"}
