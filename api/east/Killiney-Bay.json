Killiney Bay is where this green belt enters the sea. One of the prettiest bays around Dublin, road and place names fancifully reflect supposed Italian counterparts S of Rome. White Rock at O266-257 is 600<em>m</em> past Sorrento Point and has rocky outcrops with popular bathing places. A gravel beach runs the next 6.5<em>km</em> to Bray. The railway runs just inland of the northern part, the station being where the footbridge is visible at O260-242. 2<em>km</em> offshore at this N end of the bay is the shallow Frazer Bank, which has an enormous effect upon the flood tide. One branch of the tide flows in a curve close along inshore and veers eastwards to meet the main tide flooding northwards in the direction of Dalkey Island and the Muglins. The two streams collide just SE of Dalkey Island. A severe dose of bumpy water is thus set up. The spot is infamous, with wild but somewhat controlled conditions. <strong>County Wicklow</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The East Coast**"}
