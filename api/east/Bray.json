Now it is virtually a suburb of the metropolis. As a legacy, a wide promenade runs the entire 1.5<em>km</em> length of the town front, from Bray Harbour at O270-193 in the N to Bray Head at O276-179 in the S. The entire promenade is given over to tourism, amusement arcades in the S with pubs and B&amp;Bs at the other end. The River Dargle enters the sea through the harbour. It dries out at LW when it is not a particularly attractive embarkation point, being very silted. There is a slipway and beach in the harbour, which is usable on the top two-thirds of the tide. There is another slipway on the outside of the N pier. A Martello Tower stands at the base of the S pier.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The East Coast**"}
