This is a Birdwatch Ireland reserve since May 1987. Kayakers landing should be sensitive to the effects of disturbance in the breeding season (April / June). The island has both a geological and natural history interest. There are breeding Fulmar, gulls, Oystercatcher and Shelduck, while in winter the numbers of Brent Goose, Curlew, Purple Sandpiper, Ringed Plover and Short-eared Owl make the island a nationally important site. Land easily at the NW side onto a beach under the Martello tower. This beach is on the N side of a spit reaching out W towards the mainland, and is usually sheltered. The passage between Shenick Island and the mainland virtually dries out at LW.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The East Coast**"}
