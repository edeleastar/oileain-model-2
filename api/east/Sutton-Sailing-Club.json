Even here at LW, there is something of a carry, and the parking is very tight. So, if doing a shuttle, leave vehicles at Howth Harbour, irrespective of the direction of the kayak journey. The Club is welcoming, but realistically, the parking is inadequate. The Sailing Club is easily found by car, being well signposted. From Sutton Cross take the road to the Hill of Howth and, after 1<em>km</em>, turn right into Strand Road. Follow the signposts along the shoreline to the club.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The East Coast**"}
