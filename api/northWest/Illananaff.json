It has a rocky hummocky geology and has a dense yet walk able vegetation of heather, dwarf Juniper and rough grasses. The best landing is in the SE corner onto a small stony/sand beach at the obvious narrow cut that separates Illananaff from An tOilean Leathan. This cut is almost always navigable by sea kayak except perhaps at the lowest of spring tides. Camping is possible above the landing but more attractive options are available locally. No water fund. Otter and Mink. Juniper.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
