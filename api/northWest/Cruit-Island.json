The island runs N/S, is narrow, being 4<em>km</em> long and 1<em>km</em> wide, and achieves a modest 26m in height in the middle. A golf links is spread out over most of the N end of the island. The clubhouse is just above a sheltered beach and slipway at B724-224. In the middle of the island, just SE of the highest point, is a most pleasant caravan/campsite at B734-205 on commonage, with water on tap. Rock climbing has been developed nearby, mostly on the W side, in the elbow just W of the high point. Although on good granite, it is small and a poor relation of the climbing on Owey. Landing and Camping The sand flats on the E side of the island dry out and extend to just beyond the campsite so arrive and depart at HW. Circumnavigation is possible only on the very top of the tide as the S/SE parts dry. No shopping or similar facilities were found on the island but the mainland is accessible on foot. Local HW and LW are Galway +0100. Tidal streams in Owey Sound coincide with local ebb and flood, or half an hour later, flowing very strongly indeed and can cut up very rough in contrary winds. The best boating is at the NE corner, where one may explore attractive narrow channels and caves.  A distinctive cave called locally “<em>An Chat</em>” (the cat) is worth finding.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
