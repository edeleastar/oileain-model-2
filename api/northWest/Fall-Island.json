There is a holiday home on its outside NW end, accessed across the beach by a rough roadway.  At LW it is surrounded on three sides by sand.  Very beautiful.  No camping. Here where the mainland roadway joins the access beach at Cloch Ghlas B712-174 lies the monument to the Skifjord tragedy of 30th October 1981. 6 men were lost when it struck a reef in a storm.  4 of the crew made it ashore in mountainous seas onto Inishinny 1<em>km</em> N.  This all came hard for the people of west Donegal after the recent tragedies on Rathlin Oâ€™Birne a handful of years before.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
