A deep bay near the E side of the north coast. Attractive looking on the map, this is a sheltered (NB â€“ not from N swells) storm beach with possible camping. There is water in nearby houses and this beach will appeal to some for its sense of remoteness. Its importance is its status as a jumping off point, providing conditions are suitable, for the round trip.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
