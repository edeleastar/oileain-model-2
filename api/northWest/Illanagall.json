The passage between it and Eighter may dry totally at periods of LWS.  The island has very pleasant walking as the sward is heavily grazed. The W end has small cliffs and rocky outcrops to explore. No water found.  Camping is magnificent, as on nearby Eighter Island.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
