It is accessible on foot from the main landing beach on Umphin Island at times of very LWS. The island is larger, bigger than one would expect.  It deserves a visit, not least for the views it gives over the main landing beach on Umphin Island. Landing is onto a tiny beach at its SW corner at LW, otherwise onto rock shelves at other times. The island guards the entrance to Umphin and together they form an attractive bay and landing zone for the main island. Grazed by Geese in April 2009. No water found.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
