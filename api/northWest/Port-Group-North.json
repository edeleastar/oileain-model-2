At LW and calm conditions, it is possible to access the NE part of the group by land on foot, boulder hopping from a stormbeach 500m NW of the road end, after a scamble down the cliff above. Prominent among the group is an L shaped wedge, with twin sea arches.  The climbing on it and elsewhere hereabouts is characterised as a combination of immaculate rock, primary jungle comprising mud/scree/grass, and considerable exposure up top.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
