There is a dependable landing point onto a very sheltered storm beach in a channel on NE side, which can be entered on most states of tide, but which dries to the SE at LWS. A small ruin of a bothy remains tucked away in the hollow by the landing Camping and water The most possible camping is at the landing storm beach.  Water is to be found in several spots. The most convenient for campers is runoff from steep ground at the right hand side of landing storm beach (as viewed from sea). Umfin was found to be heavily grazed by geese in April 2009. Only 2 Greylag Geese were spotted, but the strong suspicion is that Barnacle also occur. Shag, Black Guillemot, Common, Herring, GBB and LBB Gulls breed, and a hint of Storm Petrel occurring?</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
