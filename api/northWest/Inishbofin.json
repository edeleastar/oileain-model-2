Mains water and electricity were supplied in 2002. Now there is even a hostel to welcome the visitor, tel 074 9162070 or visit www.teachjohnny.com. The island is very pleasant and every summer the former residents come back to live and work so that a vibrant community thrives for half each year. Landing There are many landing points and two landing places. One landing place is at the pier B896-360 at the inhabited village in the SE where it is important to ask for water and campsite. The second is at the lovely beach in remote Toberglassan Bay B 890-367 to the N. Corncrake Inishbofin represents a unique part of the success story for the frustrating efforts of Birdwatch Ireland to halt the Corncrake decline in Ireland. Here there was a huge increase in numbers and the first such in the country. There were 12 calling males in 1994 and more than double that in 1995. This was the first return for their policy of grant-aiding eco-friendly harvesting methods.  18 birds were calling in 2010.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
