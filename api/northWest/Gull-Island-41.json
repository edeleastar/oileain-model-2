Land on a sheltered storm beach at SE.  The cliffs E of the island are less exposed to the WSW swells and are thereby the more comfortably explored for their dramatic arches, canyons, gaps, caves and waterfalls, giving a most worthwhile excursion in this beautiful and little explored area. Land access to the base of the stack is via a 100m steep grass/mixed ground scramble beneath Slievetooey. Gull has been climbed by its outrageous, soaring landward arÃªte, which has to be seen to be believed, but is technically manageable. The stack immediately NW is technically more difficult to climb.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
