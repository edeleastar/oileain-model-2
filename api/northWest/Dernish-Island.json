The island is a pleasant mixture of stone-walled fields, patches of scrub and small copses. A green road cuts across the centre of the island connecting several ruined farmhouses with the only inhabited house at the southern landing place mentioned. The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel of 100/200m on its NE and SE sides. On the W side, an extensive boulder beach at LW connects the island to a spit of land known as Conors Island, at the extreme ENE end of Streedagh Strand. The gap is entirely impracticable to cross. Landing / Embarkation The islandâ€™s main landing is (easily onto mud/shale) at the S tip. The closest launch is from a small pier just opposite at G677-519. At LW, landing elsewhere is made difficult by extensive boulder and rocky foreshores on both the N/W sides. Landing is easier along the E inside channel though there is a good tidal flow from the inner bay area. Good camping on the NW peninsula on flat grass, for which land on the N side of the spit of the peninsula. No water found. <strong>County Donegal</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
