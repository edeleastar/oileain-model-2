This island, with Bo, together shelter the W side of the entrance to Gweedore Bay, which is the estuary leading to the town of Bunbeg. There are many good safe beach landings on Inishinny on the S and E (Gridref is at NE), but it is rocky elsewhere along the W/N sides. The gap between Inishinny and Bo is navigable at all stages of the tide. A very attractive cottage is sited on the almost separated adjoining and equally attractive island to the SW, separated by a narrow deep water channel, but the whole area to the E/SE dries at LW.  The owner values privacy.  Camping.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
