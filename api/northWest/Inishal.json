Overshadowed perhaps by Inishfree, this turf and boggy island with ruins has no particularly attractive camping spot. Land anywhere sheltered. There are the remains of a small village at the bay on S side.  Tides flow strongly on the Inishfree side. Wintertime gives good birdlife :Red Breasted Merganser, Mallard, Teal, Short Eared Owl.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
