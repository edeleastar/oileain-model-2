They tend to differ to those outside in having a much wilder, craggier feel and are much more heavily vegetated.  Most have extensive sandy shallow areas on their E fringes that dry and form a beautiful beach system.  Some even allow vehicular access to holiday homes at LW. At periods of HW, many channels and islets provide more than enough interest to merit a days inshore kayaking.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
