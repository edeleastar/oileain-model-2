Inishduff forms a useful leg-stretching waystop on passage, perhaps the island’s greatest contribution to the scheme of things. The island was once grazed but nowadays has gone wild and is given over to nettles, brambles and seabirds. SPA Storm Petrel, Barnacle Goose. Embarkation Points Inishduff is 3<em>km</em> from the nearest beach on the E side of Muckros Head, where there is poor parking at G627-742. Closest is a small pier just opposite Inishduff on the mainland, but down an uncomfortably steep roadway at G640-747. Not recommended is Fintragh Beach to the NE at G685-764, as many cars will not cope with the steep descent here either, and the road boasts a height barrier. For those on passage, the island lies in a straight line along the coast, 6<em>km</em> from St. John’s Point. There is a sheltered slipway just S of and under the lighthouse at G703-689, but cattle graze here so camping can be a problem. Also available is a beautiful sheltered beach 2<em>km</em> NE of St. John’s Point at G717-702 where there is excellent camping, but be discreet as this land belongs to the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Landing Land at either of two well-sheltered east-facing storm beaches on the very indented E side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
