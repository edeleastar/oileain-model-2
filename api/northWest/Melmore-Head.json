Also, the shuttle between Downies at C101-382 in the W and Fannyâ€™s Bay pier at C118-390 to the E is very convenient, being only about 2<em>km</em>. Parking is freely available at both, but please be considerate as both are working piers. There are many escape points even on the west side, but the beautiful Tranarossan Beach at C117-424 is a bit far in except for the hungry or the incontinent. Many of the other more NW projections boast convenient deep cuts en route, with storm beaches or better. Tides Both Sheep Haven and Mulroy Bay fill and empty much with the high and low water on the shore.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"260\"><strong>Mulroy Bay &amp; Sheep Haven</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:20 before Galway HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">1:00 after Galway HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The inner sections of Mulroy Bay behave differently and are dealt with later.

The round is probably therefore better paddled clockwise. A suggestion is to start before or at local LW to achieve a favourable LW slack (an hour or two later) at the exposed outer parts of the journey and enjoy the filling tide into Mulroy Bay. <strong>Mulroy Bay</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
