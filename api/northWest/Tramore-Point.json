An extensive and attractive sandy bay and beach becomes exposed at LW between the two islands and is a lovely place to swim at full tide. The island has great views all round and is worth a stopover for lunch or the aforementioned swim. Evidence of Otter and Mink. No water found and camping options are much better on nearby Eighter Island.  Land onto a beach on the S side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
