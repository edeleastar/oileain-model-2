While there has been a beacon on Black Rock since the 18th Century, the current lighthouse was designed by George Halpin Senior and was established in 1835. The light is 24m above sea level and flashes once every 5 seconds. It was automated in 1934. Intriguingly, the stairs to half height are up the outside, a feature unique among Irish lighthouses. The reason is that the initial design was for a beacon.  Later they built upwards, but the first 12m was solid, and they couldn’t cure that.  So the door is at half height and the stairs outside. Land E of the lighthouse, N or S sides, conditions dependent.  In either case the landing is onto boulders in rocky but sheltered harbourlets.  That on the S side is bounded by very visible raised walls.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
