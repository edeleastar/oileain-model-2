This large craggy island provides a substantial and very sheltered harbour on its inside NE side for local smaller fishing boats.  The S end of the island is heavily overgrown by heather, ferns, Honeysuckle, grass, rabbits and Sallies. The NW end is much more attractive to recreational use, being grazed by sheep and therefore attractive to camping.
