The remnants of wall systems, and the absence of gorse suggest it hasn’t been so neglected all that long.  Nowadays it is entirely given over to Ragged Robin, orchids, long grass, Shelduck, Mullet, and Mussels. Low lying and unattractive. Embarkation 2<em>km</em> W of Dungloe, the main town hereabouts, Inisheane can be reached at higher waters quite easily from the new pier and attractively upgraded slipway below the town at B767-116.  The slipway now reaches the LW channel out through the mudflats, but there isn’t always enough water to float a kayak in its shallower places, especially where it fragments into a pronounced delta as it makes the sea.  Absolutely avoid the hour and a half either side of LW.  Land to choice at HW. Alternatively there is an untidy disused factory complex at 4<em>km</em> WNW of the town B740-126 down a boreen.  There is far less mud, but the carry to the beach is awkward.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
