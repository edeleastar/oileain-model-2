A small yet interesting island that is located on the S side of North Rutland Channel at its NW extremity. The vegetation is a mix of rough grassland, machair and marram grass. Pleasant walking and camping but no water found. A small ruin is to be found in the NE corner.  Best landings are onto lovely beaches on NE, through to the SE sides that dry to allow access to small outlying islets. However the narrow channel between it and Rutland Island is always navigable.  Sheep. In January 2009 Red-breasted Merganser and Mallard were present in small numbers.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
