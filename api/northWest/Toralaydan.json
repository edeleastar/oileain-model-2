Land easily on E side. The passage between the island and headland is navigable in good conditions. The island is a reliable navigation aid as it stands out well from the coast especially when approached from the S. The island marks a useful escape point on this wild and beautiful section of the SW Donegal coast. Breeding colonies of Fulmar, Kittiwake and Guillemot. Land Access A gully runs the full cliff height on the headland facing Toralaydan. The gully is the only way down the surrounding cliffs, and is a very serious undertaking. Climb from sea level in long pitches of 20, 45, 45, 50, 20m to the cliff top, using excavated boulders as belays. The location and atmosphere are considerable! The gully is marked with a very discrete summit cairn. Summiting Ignore the very inviting direct route which is grassy at first but runs into a scree filled tricky section, that might be OK for climbers but not for wet booted people! Instead better to bear away to the N, taking the second grassy slope. The exposure is reportedly tolerable.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
