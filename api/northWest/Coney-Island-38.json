It is reachable by car with difficulty from the mainland to the SE. If driving, leave the mainland 1<em>km</em> off the Sligo/Strandhill Road at G641-369. Posts mark the roadway across 3<em>km</em> of sand. Do not attempt to drive closer than +/- 0230HW locally, which is Galway +0040. If circumnavigating by kayak (strictly top of the tide) the passage is between the 3rd and 4th posts from the island. Landing Land easiest at a pier in a small bay at G623-394 facing the mainland and Oyster Island, just N of Wards Pub at G623-391. For kayakers, the nicest aspect of the island is the W-facing beach mid-W side. Camping is possible at the N end of this beach in a lay-by at the end of the island road. Dunes cover the S end of the island. Beware of the seas off this beach which can be dangerous. Fauna Coney badgers have white noses.  Many rabbit. Mink.  Rock Pipit.  Dunlin. Of the four islands called Coney Island in Ireland, this is the one that gave its name to Coney Island in New York.  Sligoman captain Peter O’Connor plied the Atlantic aboard the <em>Arethusa</em> 240 years ago, and named the now better known American version after his homeplace.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
