This is the spit of land jutting S from midway along the S coast. On the E side, there is a lovely sandy beach, a pier with water on tap, a football pitch and short grass camping which is much more private than at the main strand on the E side. This is a working pier with associated advantages and disadvantages. Camping here is perhaps the most attractive on the island, with about a 4<em>km</em> walk to the main village, though there is a pub locally, which does excellent grub. Sheltered in almost all conditions.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
