An unexpectedly pleasant island. There are the remains of a house on the island, which was occupied until the 1960s. The island is generally low-lying and now (probably only occasionally) grazed by sheep. Marram Grass abounds. A reef extends SE of the SE point. Landing is possible on the E side of the island in a wee bay, onto sheltered boulders. Landing also possible in a narrow cut onto on to a storm beach on the S side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
