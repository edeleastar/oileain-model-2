Outside to the W of and attached to Inishinny except at HW by a sandy spit, it at once remote and accessible.  Camp here for a week and meet no one.  The spit that joins the two islands creates beautiful sandy bays either side facing N and S. Both catch driftwood.  Camping is excellent, sheltered on short grass.  A hidden gem.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
