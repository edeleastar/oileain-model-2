The pier at Raghly Point is recently extended and developed, the original being the northernmost pier built by Alexander Nimmo. The island is low-lying, ungrazed, and there is a suspicion of rodents present. Such merit as the island possesses lies in its position, especially in its feasibility as a waystop on passage, for instance to or from Inishmurray out of nearby Rosses Point. Camping would be unattractive. SPA Internationally important numbers of Barnacle Goose in season. Landing and Embarkation Landing is quite manageable onto storm beaches along its S side, either side of a sheltering off-lying rock, or in a cut at the E point. Embarkation is easiest from the N side of the horseshoe bay, 1.5<em>km</em> to the NE at G564-456, called locally Ballyconnell West. Nearby, lovely Dooneragh Point at G557-447 boasts an ancient promontory fort with multiple rampart defence systems in good condition. Knocklane Hill 1<em>km</em> to the ESE provides fine views of these islands, a World War 2 lookout recently knocked down, and an older military building with musket firing slots, of uncertain age.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North-West**"}
