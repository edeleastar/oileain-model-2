There are remains of at least two old ruins along the E side. No sandy beaches found but there are plentiful landings available onto stony muddy creeks. The island is regularly grazed by cattle. This is a pleasant enough island with some interesting nooks to explore at the S end through islands and channels. Good variety of camping sites but no water found.
