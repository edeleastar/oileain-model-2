This tidal race at the mouth is almost entirely avoidable by those travelling in small boats, so access in or out of the bay is always possible. Spring tides converge with convenient, midday low tides, giving a good flow for a tour out of the bay and into Clifden Bay to the S, or Cleggan or Ballynakill Bays to the N. The most convenient put in point in upper Streamstown Bay is L636-532 near the head of the bay on the N side, over 1<em>km</em> from the main road, sheltered by a tiny spit of land that is almost an island, near a graveyard.  There is ample parking for all but very large groups. It is also possible to put in on the S side. This is beside the bridge at L640-525, 1<em>km</em> from the fork off the main road from Clifden to Letterfrack. The road is being widened hereabouts but it is still necessary to be considerate with the parking. Best feature of all in the bay is the paying campsite entered from the road on the N side of the bay at L588-548.  Long may it remain unsophisticated and welcoming, with its private beach at L587-547, safe for all, short cropped grass, and adequate if minimalist services.  A truly beautiful spot, even by sea kayaking standards.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
