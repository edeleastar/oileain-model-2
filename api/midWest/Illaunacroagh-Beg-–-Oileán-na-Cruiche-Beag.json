This smaller island is quite attractive. It was not grazed in August 2009 but traces of an old sheep pen were found near the obvious landing on the E side. This landing is onto rock shelves. There is a storm beach above this landing that may also become available at times of HWS. The island’s natural vegetation is more interesting than that on Illaunacroagh More and both its geography and birdlife are more varied. Good camping available and although pools of seepage water were found in pools above the landing, the quality was doubtful. Shags, Herring &amp; GBB Gulls breed and both Meadow Pipit and Skylark are much more numerous than on the bigger (grazed) island.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
