A single modern house stands at the harbour in the mid-E side.  Substantial stone walls modernly guard the shore and local tracks.  A pontoon and electricity / water pump and heavy machinery suggest industry.  A lovely slipway welcomes the kayaker.  Goats, dogs, rabbits, ducks and geese suggest effort.  Ask permission to linger here. The N of the island is almost waisted.  Nice beach in W cut of waist. A collection of ruined houses and associated pathways show this was always an island in which the occupiers took pride. The island is manifestly a working farm and should be approached as such.
