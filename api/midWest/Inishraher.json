Land perhaps therefore in the SW, below a man-made cut through the cliff above.  Poor camping.  Sheep. Flagpost and bunting on summit. Inishraher is unfortunately a victim of the 2008+ Irish recession.  It suffers the hideous eyesore of an abandoned building site, that boasts the grand name of the “Clew Bay Centre for World Peace”.  This consists of 8 unfinished buildings and associated crud which sadly make the nice beach on the E side somewhat less attractive.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
