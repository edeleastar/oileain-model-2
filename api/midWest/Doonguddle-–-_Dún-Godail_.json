The island is bigger than one would expect, rising to 12<em>m</em>. When approached from the N the smaller Doonguddlebeg is not obvious against its bigger neighbour. The channel between the two is narrow but looks passable at all stages of the tide. Landing is onto rock shelves in the channel between the two. This N side, although subject to surge and scend, is quite accessible at HW and may be even more so at LW, as large areas of reef dry out.  Landings are also possible onto reefs on the E side but these are a little more exposed. The island has twin summits of rounded but easily climbed rock, and there is a really inviting deep water rock pool on its E side. A Spanish trawler, the ‘Arosa’, went aground and was shipwrecked here on 3rd October 2000 in a storm. Of the crew of 13, only one was saved. 2 others were taken off alive but died en route to hospital. Of the 10 that drowned, only 4 bodies were recovered, 6 being lost altogether. Evidence of breeding Shags, GBB Gull and Herring Gull.  Other species recorded in August 2008 were Grey Seal, Turnstone, Oystercatcher, Kittiwake, Curlew, Whimbrel. Gannet, Manx Shearwater, Auks and Storm Petrel. Good fishing.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
