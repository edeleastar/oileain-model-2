They are smaller in height than either Skerdmore, Skerdbeg or Doonguddle, rising to 9m and 8m respectively. Like all the islands in this group the same exposed Atlantic feeling pervades.  Both islets may best be landed at times before or after local HW as rock shelves become more exposed. The best landing found on Doonmane was along the N side onto steep shelving rock ramps in a small cut.  Good rock pools and super views of main the Skerd islands. No camping and no water. Landing on Doonmanebeg L659-263 is onto rock platforms on its NE side, facing Doonmane. It rises to a rounded summit and has several large rock pools to explore. No camping. No water. Views all round superb. Shags. GBB and Herring Gull breed and Grey Seal plentiful on both islands.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
