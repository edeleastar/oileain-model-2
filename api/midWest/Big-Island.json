It been seriously let go, barely grazed by cattle, and it is rough, with ferns, heather and gorse, especially gorse. Landings are possible all around the island but beware very soft mud in the obvious bays at LW.  The reefs and islets dry sufficiently to link up with Na Rua Oileain to the S, and the suspicion is that this is the route way by which cattle are driven on to graze the island. A large glacial erratic on the N side marks what would appear to be a good HW landing and a good camping spot on a sheltered ledge. Evidence of Otter. Common Seal. Teal, Mallard, Snipe and Black Guillemot noted in March 2008.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
