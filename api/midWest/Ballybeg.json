No sheep were present in August 2008, and consequently there is a nice wild flower mix. An interesting enough place , the main interest is in the twin narrow cuts on the W side, where there is nice cliff scenery especially from kayak level. The S cut nearly bisects the island. Shag colony in this cut and breeding Greater and Lesser Black backed Gulls, and Herring Gulls. Oystercatcher, Curlew, Whimbrel, Knot, Redshank, Turnstone all noted in August 2008. Resident Grey Seal colony. Deep water landing is possible through an inlet on the NE side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
