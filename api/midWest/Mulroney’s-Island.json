Worth a visit, if only to view a huge oyster shell midden which occupies almost the entire NW end of the island. Landing is at its most practical at HW, when one may land at the NE side. No water. Good secluded camping spot if attending<em>Crinniú na mBád</em>, the authentic festival of traditional Irish W coast boats. These are principally the Hooker (<em>Bád Mór</em>), and the smaller <em>Gleoiteóg</em> and <em>Néamhóg.</em> The <em>Crinniú</em> is held annually on the middle weekend in August. Tides in parts of the bay reach 1.5kn in springs.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
