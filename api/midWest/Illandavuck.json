The island has quite an extensive area of marine grasses, sea campion, sea pinks and sorrel that cover the summit plateau and extend down its southern and eastern flanks. There is an attractive sea cave and arch located on the southern side. The large rocky islet off the islands north eastern side is named as Erris Head on the old OS  6 inch maps but curiously they donâ€™t show the islet as separate from Illandavuck. The island held breeding Greater black-backed Gulls 60+, Fulmar 80+ and a pair of Bonxies in June 2014. There was a suspicion that Manx Shearwater may also breed but not confirmed. No water found and camping would involve a difficult carry to the summit plateau. The views are well worth the effort of landing.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
