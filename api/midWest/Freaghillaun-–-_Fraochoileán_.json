Very pleasant feel and aspect to this island. The western side of the island is short cropped grass and very pleasant. The name <em>Fraoch Oileán</em> in Gaelic means ‘Heather Island’, probably the single most common name for an Irish offshore island. Uniquely among such islands, in this case the name is inappropriate, as no heather was found. The dominant vegetation is maritime variety of gorse that blooms in July/August. Plenty of sheep and 20 Snipe were flushed on short walkabout in January 2008.  Waders included Ringed Plover, Turnstone, Oystercatcher, Purple Sandpiper, Curlew and Redshank at lovely beaches. The small islet to SE held 50 Cormorant as a roost spot.  Common Gull were seen in summer 2006. No water either. Embarkation and Landing As for Inishbigger, embark from the car park in the centre of the beach at L746-339. Land onto lovely sandy beaches on both sides of a sheltered spit at the eastern point of the island. Camping is immediately above the beach.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
