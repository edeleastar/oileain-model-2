The clay cliffs all round are especially dangerous at the W/SW sides.  Lazybeds. Land at a low grassy area on the E side.  Here there is a low grassy area with its own small salt-lake.  Sheep, all with long curly horns. The closest launching spot has almost no parking at all, down a boreen, at L633-471, where there is barely room for one car. Launch more reliably at any of the beautiful beaches where the Clifden / Ballyconneely road touches along Mannin Bay 1<em>km</em> S. <strong>Galway West Coast</strong> <strong>The Inner Islands</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
