Shallow water to N.  Attractive. Its finest features are at the E tip.  Here are found a nice landing spot onto gravel either side of the NE spit, swimming in summer at HW, nice camping, a broadleaf copse of beech, ash, sycamore and hawthorn, an old ruin of a fine house, and a strange rampart.  No money was spared building the house, and one wonders at the importance it possessed maybe hundreds of years ago.  A rampart can safely be said to be older, and its importance years ago only guessed at.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
