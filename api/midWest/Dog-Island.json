Big footprint especially at LW.  Rough grass covers the top, which supports half a dozen shhep, besides Shellduck, Great Black backed Gull, Herring Gull and Atlantic Seal. A little rough for camping, and no water.  Great views. Landing is soft enough in a dogleg inlet in the ESE corner.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
