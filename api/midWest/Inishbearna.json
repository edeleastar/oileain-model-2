Unnamed on the OS map, this craggy island is well named locally, as it is jammed in the very mouth of Killary Harbour. It has a hillock running WNW/ESE. There are great views from the summit. The main channel passes through on its N side, the narrower channel on its S side being called Smuggler’s Gap. There is a tower on the summit, tiled white to seaward. With a similar tower on Doonee Island, also unmarked on the OS map, at L748-662, it forms a transit for safe passage for larger craft through the reefs S of Inishdegil.  Land easily onto a small stony beach at L762-658 on the E side, just under and NE of a ruined bothy. Tides The tide runs in for 6 hours from 5 hours before Galway HW at up to 0.5kn until Bundorragha, when it increases to 1.5kn approaching the Erriff River, northeast of Leenane. Tides in the inner half flow stronger and start and finish later. Inside Killary Harbour, there are several new leading lights associated with visitors’ moorings just west of Leenane. Also there are new lights marking most of the mussel farms.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
