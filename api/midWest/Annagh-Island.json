It is flat as a pancake and mostly ungrazed bog.  There are some stands of forestry in the SW. The landing spot is anywhere but essentially where the Inishbiggle vehicular access penetrates at a boathouse at F784-046.  There is a house and shed at the mid-S and similar at the NE.  Neither is occupied regularly. It is possible to drive from the mainland across the inner sound at a spot called locally Claggan F786â€“046 to F783-046 on Annagh, for a couple of hours when the sound dries at LW.  There is a fine boreen across Annagh S of centre to about F773-053, from where the strand to Inishbiggle can be driven for the bottom half of the tide.  6 hours dry and 6 wet is the rule, springs or neaps.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
