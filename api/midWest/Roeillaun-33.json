Cattle are grazed on the island, which means functioning fences and gates, so camping cannot be recommended, except perhaps at the remote W extremities, where anyway lie the leisure seekersâ€™ attractions. Attractive sand/coral beach at the W end, with flowery meadows, shelter from wind and fine views.  Good for a lunch stop. Excellent views in to Diamond Hill and out to Bofin and Shark. There are the ruins at the E end of a small village of half a dozen houses or so, now roofless and overgrown, deserted in the mid 20th century. Surrounded by trees.  Lazybeds in places.  Remnants of a small roadway.  No water found.  Access from the quay [Nimmo] at L688-598, near which small museum and at which good parking.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
