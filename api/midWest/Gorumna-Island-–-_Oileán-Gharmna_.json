This quay does not dry out as much as other local quays that are convenient for exploring the bay. Much of the island is referred to locally as <em>Máimín</em> or Maumeen, and parts as <em>Tír an Fhia</em>. The island is very much in the heart of the Irish speaking <em>Gaeltacht</em> area. There is a roadway along much of the NW side. The quays and bays of the S and E are more isolated from each other. A most attractive pub, <em>Tí Antaine Laoi,</em> in the SW at the Lettermullan Bridge serves excellent seafood. Tides flood N round both sides of the island meeting in a lagoon trapped between it and Lettermore.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
