It is nearly split in two, being joined by an area of marshy reeds at its narrow waist. The interior of each sector is very wooded, and would need local knowledge to explore. There is an abandoned farmhouse by the landing spot which is at the usual mud / rock compromise at the S end of the W “beach”. There is a square tower at the NE end, with an Augustinian friary ruined beside it.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
