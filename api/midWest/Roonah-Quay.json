There are almost continuous breaking swells over a long rock ledge running out W from the pier. This is the embarkation place for the ferry to Clare Island, with waiting room, public phone, and toilets nearby. Roonah is a corncrake stronghold. Launching is difficult, from the steps or a boulder beach adjacent. In northerlies, a better spot for small groups is the N end of sandy White Strand beach just S of Emlagh Point at L747-797, about 1<em>km</em> to the S, reachable easily by road from Roonah. Larger groups will prefer the S end of the beach at L748-788.  More dependable, but less convenient, on the Clew Bay side is the sand-silted Carrowmore Pier at L794-817. It is just NW of Louisburgh, within walking distance, and has toilets.. Another launching point is Old Head Pier (one of Nimmoâ€™s), about 4<em>km</em> further E at L834-824 where there is a hotel but is otherwise remote from facilities.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
