The island is different from the rest in the group due to its height difference. A mini “Sugarloaf” like hill dominates the centre of the island.  Its 30m summit contrasts with the other islands in the area. Croghnut is craggier than its immediate neighbours and is an attractive mixture of heather, scrub and grassland. There are remains of an old cottage or booley on a ledge above the E landing, tucked under the summit. The island has extensive areas of foreshore that become somewhat exposed at LW, and would appear to dry completely at its N point where it joins with Illaunacroghnut, its low lying but bigger sister. The summit has good views over the entire area, the island group and of the Twelve Bens. In winter, Curlew, Ringed Plover, Red-brested Merganser, Mallard &amp; Teal. Landing Landings can be found onto stony beaches on all sides of island but are best at the S / E sides at obvious cuts. Camping and water Camping is available at a number of sites, particularly at the S end. No water was found, but the presence of a small herd of cattle in January 2008 would indicate its presence.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
