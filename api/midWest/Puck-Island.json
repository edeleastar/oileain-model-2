Little in the way of redeeming features. The island is rock strewn with glacial erratics interspersed with small knolls, hollows and marshes. Several deep fresh water pools were located. A HW landing marked by distinctive stone bollard and iron stacks along the N side. Landing is onto obvious cut along the N edge, but is also possible at several other places along the S side. The “Pass” between it and Inishbarra almost dries and in particular, a rock ledge runs diagonally SW from Puck to almost close the gap. A series of small broken fields in the NW corner is the best camping. Otter.  There was some evidence of recent grazing by cattle in March 2008.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
