Land and/or camp near the lighthouse on short flat grass, to be out of the way.  There is a single house at the main landing pier at the inhabited NE tip.  The island is farmed â€“ sheep and cattle.  A good track passes between the NE and the SW lighthouse area. Land by the lighthouse on the SE facing side in the lee of a windlass ramp, or on the NW facing side as conditions dictate. Lovely place although the new gabion type pier, protective gabion type walls and ruined landing on W side give feeling of decay and disorder not typical of lighthouse islands. 2 Divers.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
