The main concern will be the sea swell. Unless conditions are very benign, there will be many hidden reefs below the surface and almost any swell will produce boomers. Keep 2/2.5<em>km</em> off Spanish Point itself.  Until well with Liscannor Bay, one must be on the lookout at all times and in every direction. Once around the point, head back in towards the bay at Cleadagh Bridge R037 797. There are one or two small unremarkable caves along the low cliffs. A stony beach is inaccessible in larger swell. White Strand (“Travaun”) is a very sheltered bay and accessible at any time R038-806. You can expect a breaking wave off Freagh Point R032-816 and another boomer 300<em>m</em> out from this on a low reef.  Paddling between these two waves is unpredictable. The options are to head well off shore, save however that on the upper half of any tide, there is a very narrow gap right in at the beach between Freagh Island and the mainland. A few small caves on the far side of Green Island R047-832 are worth a look. The bay to the S of Liscannor is Lehinch and a famed surf spot, absolutely to be avoided by sea kayaks. That said, fun is to be had there, and, at HW one may enter the Inagh River R083-886, and then all the way up to Ennistymon. The practical thing is to head for Liscannor Harbour (Nimmo) R068-884. <strong>Liscannor to Doolin</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
