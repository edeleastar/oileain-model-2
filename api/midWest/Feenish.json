Two rolling hills of grass and ragwort give a nice open feeling.  Two lonely hawthorns are the only trees.  Herds of cattle are confined to their section by electric fences (that do sting !).  Lingerers or campers will ensure they are in a quarter different to the grazing livestock.  There is an attractive stone cottage on the SE side.  Agricultural access is from the NE. The best landing is on a lovely shingle beach on the SW side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
