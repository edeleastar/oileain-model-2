Cruagh appears from the mainland as a large, exposed haystack-shaped lump of a heathery fern and grass island, out west of Omey. In fact, on close inspection, Cruagh is a hugely attractive island with superb walking. At over 63m, it is almost as high as High Island. It has magnificent cliff scenery on the northern side, and spectacular spires in the NW. The island from a distance gives no hint to its variety of hidden valleys within the rocky outcrops and hillocks. There is a Manx Shearwater colony of some importance on the island besides Breeding Great Black-backed Gull, Herring Gull, Rock &amp; Meadow Pipit, Skylark.  A single Peregrine was seen on NW side. Deep-water landings only are available, in sheltered creeklets on the eastern side.  The three modern wooden hut structures just above the most sheltered landing spot are in good order.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
