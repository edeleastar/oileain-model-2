A small abandoned cluster of houses is built at the SE corner. These are built right down to the HW mark onto scoured and rounded ‘roches moutonées’, with a natural ‘pier’. The ‘village’ is reminiscent of similar developments much, much further N in Norway and Greenland where they also build right down to or over the HW mark. Land onto slabs at the pier by the houses.
