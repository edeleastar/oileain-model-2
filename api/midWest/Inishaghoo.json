They do this very well.  A good old race sets up between Inishaghoo and Inishbiggle, and a lesser one between Inishaghoo and the mainland, but neither race compares in the least to Bulls Mouth at the NW of Inishbiggle. It is feasible to walk to Illanamona for periods at either side of LW  and to wade across to Inisaghoo from the larger Illanamona at LWS.  The electricity powerlines run overhead the larger Illanamona island and Inishaghoo towards inishbiggle. Inishaghoo is surprisingly grassy given it isnâ€™t grazed, or grazed enough nowadays, and could be attractive to the recreational user if it were.  Suspicion of foxes. The islands and particularly Inishaghoo are interesting for being a blanket peat bog resting on underlying sand/silt, which is quite the educational sight.  Bog oak protrudes aplenty from the very base of the peat and the peat itself runs under the tide in places.  The coastal erosion is as inexorable and as fiersome as one might imagine, especially on the exposed sides.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
