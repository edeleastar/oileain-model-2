Six people permanently reside.  Here there is an excellent new pier and pontoon.  All is farmed, cattle and sheep.  Ask about camping. The <em>Inishlyre</em> (formerly the <em>Newfyne</em> registered out of San Lorenzo in Honduras 1965, also formerly the <em>Glenfyne</em>, also formerly serving the Aran Islands out of Galway in the 1990s, sadly lay for a long time nearly derelict against the new pier on the E side, but has now been cut up and scrapped in pieces.  A great pity.  Much older boats are still are still at it.  A mystery ship, as they say. 25 Brent Geese + 4 Divers.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
