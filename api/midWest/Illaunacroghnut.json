It is low lying and full of knolls, hollows, wet marshes and stands of willow. The vegetation although grazed periodically is rough and wild. Exploration is for the determined only. The island is very nearly joined to Croghnut Island at its SW corner where there is just a very narrow channel dividing the two, and then only at times of HW.  There is also a good landing at this SW corner onto a stone beach, but numerous other landings are also possible. A stone wall, its purpose rather a mystery, exists above the landing at the SW corner. Red-breasted Merganser, Teal, Mallard, Grey Heron, Turnstone and Snipe.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
