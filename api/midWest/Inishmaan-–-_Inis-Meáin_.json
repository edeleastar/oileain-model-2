The island has an airport, ferry, provisions, B&amp;B, pub, chipper and general facilities. An attractive island, almost exclusively Irish speaking. Note Dun Connor (<em>Dún Chonchúir</em>), which is one of the finest, complete ring forts in existence, oval in shape. The church was built in 1939 has an altar made by stonemason James Pearse, father of Patrick Pearse, 1916 Rising leader.  Rock climbing on Inishmaan has developed since about 2001. Landings and Camping L946-046        The main landing spot is at Cora (<em>An Córa</em>), at the pier, or the beach nearby just NE for camping. L954-060        At the NE corner, along the beautiful beach called Sandhead (<em>Ceann Gainimh</em>), but which dumps. Be careful not to disturb nesting Terns in spring and early summer. No water. L943-067        Pier at E end of bay on N called <em>An Caladh Mór</em>, but there is a long carry at LW. No water. Findable in darkness. L934-067        Better for the NW end of the island, there is a small pier and slipway, called <em>Port na Cora</em>. The carry is manageable at LW, there is convenient camping, and there is good water in a well nearby, up the boreen. This is also the best jumping off point for Inishmore. Difficult to find in darkness.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
