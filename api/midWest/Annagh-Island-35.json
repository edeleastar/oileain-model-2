Land in obvious cut at E corner. No water found and camping vey unattractive.  Really a big blocky detachment from the head, a deep narrow cut separates it (wadable only at LWS) sufficiently to provide sufficient isolation to give comfort for nesting seabirds. The island rises E to W in gradient and W side has similiar attractive cliff line as Annagh Head.  The narrow cut is mostly navigable to kayaks but would be quite challenging in any W/NW blow.  Narrow as this channel may be, it is deep, and protects colonies of &gt;60 pairs of Arctic Tern and &gt;30 pairs of Common Gull that bred here 2009 and 2010. The island serves as a useful breakwater to a bay just to its NE, where there is a new surfaced road and a new parking spot for Annagh Head, from which it is a convenent short carry to the shoreline, especially at HW. This launching spot is especially useful for a quick daytrip to Inishglora, Inishkeeragh, or Eagle.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
