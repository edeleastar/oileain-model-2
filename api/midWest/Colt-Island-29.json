From the shore, approach with permission through the grounds of the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station grounds. From the sea, land at the NE or SW cut between shore and island, both sheltered, that to the NE easier of access. It is an island of two halves, the more shoreward being rough pasture, slightly grazed by cattle and the camping is not great. The unexpected treat in this island is the seaward half, which contains a tidal lagoon that makes for a splendid swimming and sunbathing area.  Approachable by sea at all stages of the tide from the NW, the lagoon is partly surrounded by scraped rocks, ideal for recreational purposes.  The water never drops below at least 1m.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
