Alternatively, it can be approached from several other mainland departure points in the Mace Head area. Illaunacroagh More is low lying overall and the rounded Connemara granite, boulder like erratics and rocky outcrops provide interest. The island is grazed by sheep and attractive to walk. The W side has extensive areas of rock slabs that, combined with the great views all round, give an exposed Atlantic experience to the walker. Landing is at an obvious cut along the E side onto rock slabs. There are the remains of a sheep pen just above the landing. A second possible landing point is onto a storm beach just S of the cut but this only possible at times of local HW.  It makes for an excellent days kayaking. No water found but camping is good. Breeding Herring and GBB Gulls and Oystercatcher.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
