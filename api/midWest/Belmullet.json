A lock-free canal is navigable to kayaks on at least the 2 hours either side of local HW. This gives easy passage from Blacksod Bay into Broad Haven. The canal has recently been made over. Belmullet is a most useful town on passage. A market town, all facilities are available. Tides The tide flows simultaneously into Blacksod Bay and Broad Haven, meeting on the drying mudflats on the Broad Haven (eastern) side of the town. The flow in the canal is usually from Blacksod towards Broad Haven, and reaches 4kn in springs. The mudflats on the Broad Haven side are severe, so don’t miss the tide. Approach and leave Belmullet near HW. Local HW is Galway HW +0040. An excellent evening meal is available in the hotel, and a handy B&amp;B is with Eileen Gaughan, Mill House, American Street, Belmullet, tel. 097  81181. Her garden backs onto the canal just on the Broad Haven side. Kayaks can be left here conveniently and securely, which is otherwise a problem. Camping near the town is unattractive.  On passage, the first attractive waystop/camping to the N is at Ballyglass by the lifeboat station F765-353, or even better, Rinroe Point pier – <em>Barr na Rinne</em> at about F802-406.  To the S, do not approach closer than Ardmore Point F687-277, and the better choices are at Elly Bay or best of all Blacksod Point pier F651-187. <strong>Kid Island</strong>    </p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
