It is shallow and therefore only really suitable on the top half of the tide. The tidal cycle is later than outside, about HW Galway +0040 in neaps, +0100 in springs. The bay is much used by the outdoor pursuits centre at Turlough, near Bell Harbour at the head of the bay, for beginner windsurfing, canoeing, and sailing. Entry is easiest at M272-114 at a small pier beside a hexagonal monument on the roadside. Reasonable parking.  The SW side of the bay has a large seal colony, and some otters.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
