One householder lives there, who is a noted builder and sailor of traditional craft. The main landing place is at the newly improved but very untidy pier in bay on the northern side. It is also easy to land elsewhere. There is an interesting, very low water, artificial causeway to the mainland via several islets to the SE, but do not regard this as a tidal island. Worth a visit. The western part of the passage between Gorumna and Lettermore is easily passable at HW only, but sets up an interesting marine waterfall on the ebb, and then dries. There are beaches all along the S curve of the island, with camping by ruins on the W side of the S tip.  A lovely harbour at the WNW is accessible at the top half of the tide. A network of boreens makes exploration easy, and the ground is manageable.  Admire the flat topped national school, 1934, most unusual.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
