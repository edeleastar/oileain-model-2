Once inhabited but the houses are now in ruins. Land on a stony beach on the southern side. There is drinking water at a drip feed from an artificial pool under the cliff by the landing. Camping is available on the bluff above the landing. Other landings are possible, including in a lagoon between the main island and a detached 14m high satellite smaller island on the W side, where one may step out onto tidal peat, best at cove midway along NE side. The channel between the two probably dries at LWS.  Both parts of the island are grazed by sheep and both therefore campable.  Freaghillaun South and its separated little brother are worth a visit. There are fish cages to the E of the island. There is a significant tide race off Ross Point, 3<em>km</em> ESE. Ballynakill Bay fills from Galway HW -0500. The tides are generally weak, except at the narrows.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
