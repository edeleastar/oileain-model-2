Lying off the S side of Gorumna, Illaunnanownim, with its cairn, is a prominent navigation marker for passing boats. It is sheep grazed and a pleasant island to visit or camp on, though no water was found. Embarkation Set out from a wonderfully remote but busy enough quay called <em>Cé Pholl UíMhuirinn</em> L868-210, found at the end of a long boreen, and this area generally feels about as remote as it gets.  From the level modern hardstand, a small staircase (easily missed) leads down to a creek that dries for about 100m at LW, before it gives onto the open water.  The sound inside the island is sandy, giving nice swimming. Loughcarrick (means “Flat Stone”) at L868-203 is really just a low lying rocky projection to the SW.  One may walk between the two save at the highest HW.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
