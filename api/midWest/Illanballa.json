Halfway in, at an elbow, on its N side, lies tiny Illanballa, probably the only near-obstruction, discounting the fish cages, which are mainly on the S side, most of the way. It is only a small rock, but grass covered, and with a prominent warning light.  Most easily reached from stunningly beautiful Bundorragha L8421-633 on the Mayo side, or more conveniently for many on the Galway side from the new catamaran pier at Nancy’s Point L856-626.  There are other nearer slips on the Galway side, but with little parking.  Land into a cleft on the SE side.  Mussels galore. Well inside Killary Harbour, there are several new leading lights associated with visitors’ moorings just W of Leenane. Also there are new lights marking all mussel farms. In the outer half, tides flood from HW Galway -0500 and ebb from +0100, and reach 0.5<em>kn</em>.  Tides in the inner half flow stronger, up to 1.5<em>kn</em>, start later and finish later. <strong>Galway West Coast</strong> <strong>The Outer Islands</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
