A fine pier is found on the N side of the waist, where there is also the remains of the schoolhouse.  Houses are being done up, perhaps as holiday homes.  A fine network of boreens make the island interesting to wander around. This is an attractive, non-intensively farmed, sheltered, low, inhabited island in E-mid-Kilkieran Bay. Hay is cut by scythe and saved in haycocks. There is a landing place with camping at a pier on the NE end, the more northerly of the two piers on the E side.  There is excellent water in a well 100m up the boreen behind the house at the pier. Otters. An unusual feature is the ancient square bay cut into the old NE pier, intentionally, to house “cattle rafts”. These flat square rafts can take a dozen cows, to be transported to another part of the island, or death, or whatever.  They are still in use. Only one voter inhabits this island permanently, a gentleman, of whom ask advice about camping or anything else, locally or internationally.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
