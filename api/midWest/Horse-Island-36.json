The OS Discovery 1:50,000 sheet shows it as being attached to the mainland along its SSW flank, but in fact, the island is connected to the mainland only by a narrow steep sided storm beach. The impressive rock debris suggests that Atlantic storms surge occasionally through the gap. Landing is possible on either side but is most protected and practical on SE side. Here a narrow and attractive channel leads to the beach flanked on its N side by a narrow sea cave that is worth the look. The island yields easily to a short scramble from the storm beach It is flat and low lying and has the remains of a promontory fort. The island has several geological features of interest, from attractive outcrops, a dyke, and layered bedrock. The channel that separates the island from a sea stack on its W side is worth paddling through. Camping is good on closely grazed sea turf but requires a short steep carry above the landing. No water found. There is a ruin S of the landing on the mainland whose purpose was not identified.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
