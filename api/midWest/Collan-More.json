Land at the gravel beach at the Glenans Sailing Centre in the sheltered E facing bay in the SE opposite the access point Rosmoney Pier.  The centre was built in 1979, and though originally a French outfit, it is now entirely Irish run.  Parties of 50+ can stay at Glenans.  Two people live permanently in the centre.  The summit is just above the centre to its N. About 3 other houses are not permanently occupied, including a renovated schoolhouse to the NE.  Absentee farmed.  Little attractive camping found.  Sadly. “No Camping” signs appeared in 2010.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
