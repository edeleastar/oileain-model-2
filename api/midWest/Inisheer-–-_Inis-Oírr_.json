On Inisheer there are provisions, pubs, music, hostel, airport, ferry, B&amp;Bs, castles, ring forts, pretty scenery, nice walks, and has antiquities by the score. Saint Caban’s Church is now practically engulfed in sand. On 14 June each year the sand is cleared away and the islanders pray through the night by candle-light. Altogether a most attractive island. Irish (and English) speaking. Landings The main landing place is at a NNE facing beach, midway on the NNE side, which may dump. Otherwise, try at the pier at the W end of the beach, where the ferry comes in. There is a paying campsite behind the beach. L992-016        Trá Caorach, just W of the eastern point of the island, is a sandy beach. Nearby is the landmark wreck, the Plassey, rusting away above the HW mark since 1960. L978-007        There is a quay, just NW of the lighthouse, by a slipway.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
