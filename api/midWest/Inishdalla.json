The most remarkably wonderful aspect of the view is that despite that there is no other land hard nearby, solid land provides the horizon over 340 degrees of the available 360. Landing is onto a beach in a long narrow cut (called Boat Cove on the admiralty chart) at the N side of the E tip, marked by iron stakes and some new stone mooring points. The cut is wide enough to take small boats but narrows considerably towards the beach. At some points of the tide, the landing can be awkwardly onto boulders.  Uninhabited. There is a large colony of grey seals. No water found, but there is super camping available on flat grassy terraces.  This is probably best above the beach on N side. The island was being grazed by Sheep in August 2008. Several inter-tidal pools provide wildlife and a possible swim in moderate circumstances. Breeding gulls, Wheatear, and possibly Storm Petrel.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
