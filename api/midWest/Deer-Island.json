The farmhouse is midway on the S side. Paddling round it is reminiscent of what paddling through Counties Cavan or Monaghan may be like if and when water levels rise sufficiently. The hedgerows may be lusher though. Its steep fields are stocked with cattle and sheep. The point of embarkation dedicated to this island is at Rosscliff to the W at R288-633.  From Ennis take the first left as you enter Ballynacally. The road appears to lead into an estate but follow the rural road to the river.  Rosscliff is a long narrow slip that alows launching at all states of the tide. The channel is always open to the S, but the channel going N after Deer Island dries out. It is possible to make way NE around Deer Island and into a channel. Beware many mud flats and shallows. Parking here is limited as it is a working slip for farmers moving stock in and out to the islands. Deer Island was until 2004 unique among Irish islands for having a sole resident who was female. Nowadays the island is farmed from the mainland as an out-farm, as with all the islands hereabouts now. The passage between Coney and Inishmore dries out at just under half tide height.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
