A lake dominates the interior of the island. Many houses.  There is a ruined church and graveyard all smothered in sand, on the N side at L565-563. Human remains are visible which are being archeologically investigated by Dúchas. A lovely, worthwhile island not to be missed. Perhaps launch from Aughrusmore Pier to the NW of the island at L557-566.  Newly improved as of 2004, the pier now boasts a water tap, is much larger than before, and the parking is much better.  A beautiful spot in and of itself. Landing and Camping The inside passage at L575-562 dries mid-tide in the NE corner. Landings are possible along much of shore on the N and E sides on either side of the dry area. Also, at L573-551, there is an attractive small beach in a small cove just W of the SE corner. However, it is a bit exposed, and not very suitable for overnighting. No water. At L564-554 on the W side of the island, there is a sheltered beach in a deep bay, which is much better. There is excellent, remote, machair-type camping. There is water in a streamlet 500m NW of the beach, out of a pipe. 4 Corncrake were heard in 2003, 1 in 2010.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
