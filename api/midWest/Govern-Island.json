Far preferable for waystop or emergency is Inishdegil to the SE. There are plenty of seals but little else. Landing Landing is on the NE side where a sheltered channel is closed midway most of the time, so that the SE end is mostly flat calm.  Landing on the NW end of the channel can be on to separated rocks, so be careful. SW of Govern Island are the Carrickgaddy Rocks (Carraig Gadai – Thieves Rocks). These were named when <em>Gráinne Mhaol</em> allegedly chained some thieves to the rocks and spread mackerel on their stomachs for the gannets to dive onto. The ebb tide is often felt here where it turns SW towards Crump after spilling out of Killary.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
