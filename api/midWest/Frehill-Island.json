It is about 500m long, with an extensive area of drying rocks to the SE.  The island was sheep grazed upo to the 1980s, but no more. The island is privately owned and particular care should be taken to leave absolutely no litter, to ensure continued use for all. Landing The forced deep water landing, in moderate conditions, is at the ESE tip.  What is a channel at HW becomes a narrow lagoon sheltered by higher drying rocks on the bottom half of the tide. Entrance to the lagoon from either side is via a narrow gap. The N opening is always there but is not visible until very close.  The S opening more or less disappears at LW, leaving the lagoon often very calm.  Access up the rocks is easy and direct. Frehill would be acceptable as a waystop in calm conditions, or an emergency stop in less favourable conditions, but only on the lower half of the tide. Far preferable for waystop or emergency is Inishdegil. The ground to the N and NW outside Frehill towards Caher Island is shallow and breaks in wind. This inshore passage between Killary and Roonah is strictly for good weather only. In any kind of W swell, there are many breakers around the island. If paddling past, itâ€™s best to keep close to the N-facing shore. Particular attention should be paid to Carrick McHugh, a rock 3 cables N of the island.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
