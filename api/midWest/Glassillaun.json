Land onto a rocky/pebbly beach on S side.   Some steep and awkward climbing from landing onto a rough heather/grass top. No water.  No camping.  The only interesting feature is the very craggy S side and the nice views into Ballinakill Harbour and out to Inisbofin.  Two types of sally trees are trying to get a foothold.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
