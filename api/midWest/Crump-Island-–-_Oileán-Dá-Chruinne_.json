Landing at HW is best on a shingle beach on the NE side. This landing becomes awkward at LW so otherwise land at cove on SE side below ruined house L678-653.  Sand below half tide.  There is camping near the old, ruined, two-story house in which some shelter can be had for cooking. No water found. Farmed, cows and sheep, but lumpy, the island is attractive to explore. The story goes that when deciding where to draw the county boundary between County Mayo and County Galway, the ancient local Councillors threw a sack of oats into the ebbing tide as it spilled out of Killary Harbour. The islands that lay to the N of the oats as they floated out would be in Mayo, those to the S, in Galway. To the surprise of many, the oats floated down S of Crump and then headed out to sea. Hence, Crump is in Mayo. Editor’s Note: Crump is included with the W-facing Galway islands for convenience.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
