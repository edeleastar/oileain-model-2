Note that small half-tide reefs between Inishkeeragh and Inishglora are unduly prominent on the OS 1:50,000 map. They show as small islands, which confuses the navigator. Storm Petrel. The island is almost cut in two by a ravine. Land at the head on either side.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
