The west facing slopes are low lying, but the E side rises sharply to form a narrow attractive channel between it and Inishturk. The passage is dramatic with good rock scenery. The cut is prone to considerable swell at either entrance. Landing is easiest onto rock shelves on the W or SW corners, but would require a very calm day. Landings onto the sheltered E flank are possible, but require good rock climbing skills with rope protection to reach the grassy summit. There is good climbing available on both sides of this channel. Breeding Greater black-backed and Herring Gulls.  No water and not suitable for camping.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
