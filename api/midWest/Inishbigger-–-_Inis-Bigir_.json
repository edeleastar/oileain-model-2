It is barely circumnavigable at LW. Cattle only occasionally graze it, so the undergrowth is lush. Nevertheless, Willow Herb, Ragged Robin and Self Heal abound. Embarkation and Landing It is not really possible to camp and no water was found. The softest landing is on the landward, E side. Embark from a large car park in the centre of a beautiful beach locally called Moyrus, at L746-339, beside a graveyard and abandoned church.  An alternative launching spot for this and Freaghillaun is from a pier at L746-348 where there is sufficient parking for small groups.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
