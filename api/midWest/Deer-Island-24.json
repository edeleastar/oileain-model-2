It is 5<em>km</em> W of Eddy Island, and 4<em>km</em> SSW of Tawin. Several dozen seals will typically be lounging about in summer. Multitudinous Cormorants. Absolutely no water. Land on a beautiful, sheltered, curved, sandy beach on the SE side. A shallow bar extends from Deer Island ESE to a point NE of Aughinish Island Martello Tower (M287-136). Although the tides are not generally strong except between New Quay and Aughinish Point, the shallow water at this bar, as well as that off Aughinish Point, can be rough in wind. Embarkation Embark from around New Quay, County Clare. The easiest launch is from Church Point Beach at M274-124, or from the back of New Quay itself at M281-123. The quay was built in 1837, and is a working quay, so please respect it. At the quay is Linnaneâ€™s Bar where there is pub  grub, with the best seafood in Ireland. The nearest launch for Deer Island is from the causeway joining Aughinish Island to mainland County Galway at M295-133. Also, the island can be taken in as part of a circuit of Aughinish, as launching or landing can be easily had either side of the causeway.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
