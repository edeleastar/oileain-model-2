It is an attractive, semi-inhabited island. The pier at the W end is uninviting to passing kayaks, as it dries out, but it is in active use in 2009 with new cattle pens. There is an unusual degree of organisation to the layout of housing and roadways relative to other islands hereabouts. This may be related to the fact that the men of Mason were regarded locally as being fine builders and had much inter-connection with Finish islanders who had a strong music tradition. Mains water is available but only in the houses, 2009. Landing and Camping Land virtually anywhere on N / NE / E sides. The best camping is probably in the NE. Camping is possible at other locations, but as cattle graze the island, be sensible. In particular, on any day the cattle of the island are being gathered for slaughter on the mainland, de-camp early. Embarkation The best known launching points for Mason or MacDara’s or any of the islands hereabouts are the beach in the SW-facing elbow of Mweenish Island at L764-294, where poor-ish parking Mace Pier L742-316, where good parking, or Ard East pier, at the disused fish processing plant at L757-312, where endless parking.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
