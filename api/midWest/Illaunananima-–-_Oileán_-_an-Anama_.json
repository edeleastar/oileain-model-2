A tiny islet, 1<em>km</em> NNW of Renvyle Point, to be avoided in any kind of W swell. The waters inshore of this islet can become one seething mass of foam when swell runs, so do not be caught off guard. Otherwise, this island is a superb waystop. Land by a very secluded channel like entrance on the N-facing shore. This channel invites a swim at HW. The soil and grass on top the island are barely hanging in.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
