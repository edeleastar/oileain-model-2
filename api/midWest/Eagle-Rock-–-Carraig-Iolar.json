The island is difficult in places to walk around but nevertheless good to explore. Camping is possible but level areas not easy to find and may be best on a sandy beach at the NE corner. Landing is easiest at HW into an attractive small bay at the NE side, otherwise onto rock slabs and a boulder beach at same location. The bay is shallow, has a sandy bottom in places, and big kelp beds. Views are excellent all round and the island makes for a good lunch spot or place for a swim. A Salmon Fish farm is located N of Eagle Rock.  No water found. Breeding GBB Gull, Herring Gull &amp; Oystercatcher. Turnstone 20, Dunlin 1 and Grey Seal 2 (August 2009).</p>\n","costalZone":"**The Mid-West**"}
