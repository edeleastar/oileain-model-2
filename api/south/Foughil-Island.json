The island is low lying but contains an attractive mix of grazed fields and areas of gorse and bracken.  There is some salt marsh along its northern edge which together with the inter-tidal sand and mud flats provides good feeding zones for duck and wader species in winter. The island is a roosting site for the estuarine birds using the estuary.  Chough 2, Merlin 1 and Hare 5 were present in January 2015. The island is accessible from the stony beaches which flank the campsite at Mannix Point or from a small narrow lane V452-786 that opens onto the estuary just west of the campsite boundary. The parking here however is limited to a single vehicle and groups should perhaps ask at the campsite if for additional parking. Mannix Point is a good embarkation point for kayakers who may find themselves in the area in heavy weather when more offshore objectives are not achievable. The area allows access to the northern side of Valentia Harbour or Beginish and makes for a good day trip option. Landings can be made along all sides of the island but care should be taken at times of low water as the northern and western sides dry out.  Camping is available along the western side. No water outside of that provided for cattle was found. <strong>Coastal Section</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
