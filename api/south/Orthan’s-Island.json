On rocks all about may be found seals.  Access is easiest from the West Cork Sailing Centre based at the small slip and pier just E at V814-492.  The centre welcomes smaller parties as the parking is limited.  “Sit on Top” kayaks and Canadian style canoes may be hired, suitable for exploring the bay – <a href=\"http://www.westcorksailing.com/\">www.westcorksailing.com</a>.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
