Goats and cows graze, and there are ruined stone farmhouses. The island is interesting, varied, and attractive. There is a sea  arch in the SW. Generally a lovely island. Landing and camping There are landing places either side of the central E  W waist, on sheltered beaches, (sandy W and pebbly E). There are idyllic campsites just above both. There is a small, remote pebble beach on the SW with good camping. No water found, anywhere. Tides flood generally E and S around the island, the ebb reversing the process.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
