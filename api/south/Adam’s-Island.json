The high profiled island has very steep cliffs on the SW and E sides. Landing is possible with difficulty on the reef on the rocky N side, where it is possible to paddle through the reef. Also on the SE should conditions allow. Summitting is safe from either landing spot.  Never inhabited. No water. Tides are weak inside the harbour. “Avoid Adam, hug Eve” has always been the saying for craft entering Glandore Harbour in deference to the shallows hereabouts.  Trawler <em>Tit Bonhomme</em> collided with Adam entering the harbour and home on 15<sup>th</sup> January 2012 with the loss of 5 of the part Irish and part Egyption 6 man crew. The two communities were drawn together in grief for the 26 days it took hundreds of volunteer and professional searchers to locate all the bodies.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
