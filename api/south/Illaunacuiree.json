Detached at all stages of the tide.  Long and thin, and grassy, yet uninspiring.  Access from Cuas Quay ENE. <strong>Kerry</strong> <strong>Kenmare River to the Dingle Peninsula</strong> <strong>County Kerry</strong> <strong>Ardgoom Harbour</strong> This pretty and well sheltered harbour, wooded all along its inner parts, straddles the Cork / Kerry border, about halfway down the N side of the Beara.  It is somewhat divided into an inner and outer section by a long spit of land jutting out from its W side called “Cus”.  Cus shelters the main embarkation point for the whole bay at the busy working Pallas Pier V703-576.  Here there is ample parking for larger groups.  The inner bay is much given to mussel fishery.  More convenient to the main road is a small slip at V704-563 in the inner SW reaches of the bay, but parking is very limited.  Very small parties may prefer Dog’s Point on the outside bay on the W side V702-582, but even a second car would be a challenge.  Ardgroom village has most facilities including a wonderful restaurant.  There are no put in points on the E or Kerry side at all.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
