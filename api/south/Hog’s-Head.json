Reports exist of individuals having scrambled across the gap, but by far the easier option is to float up to the sheltered NE corner where a landing is very feasible onto shelves / boulders.  Scramble up to where stakes are embedded in the turf, suggesting occasional grazing use.  Lovely grass throughout.  Highly identifying boulder on summit looks erratic but is actually sandstone. Stunning views of awesome climbing cliffs nearby, and islands big and small further off, to S &amp; W.  Offlying Pig’s Rocks V461-615 would be a challenging landing?  Seals.  Definitely a place to while away some time. Launch from a slipway 2.5km E at V493-616.  Note the boatshed <em>en route</em> at Coosawaud  V475-610 which is nearer but doesn’t appear so easy a launch at all at all, and anyway the approach “road” to it would be frighteningly tricky, even judged by the standards of the local metalled thoroughfares, which are hair raising enough for most folks.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
