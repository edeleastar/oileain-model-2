It is backed by a sandy beach with car access almost to the beach. There is limited parking on the “street” near the pub, but 200<em>m</em> N of the beach there is further parking in a rough grassy car park (height barrier). Discrete camping may be possible in this car park at off peak times, but in summer this is a very popular destination with Corkonians.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
