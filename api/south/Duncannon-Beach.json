Park above the beach, or for the lazy, drive onto the beach and unload.  In guaranteed daylight, going and coming, this is by far the better option.  Nevertheless, no matter how lazy, do not leave a car here.  The tide does return.  Launching / landing at LW is best on the N end of the beach for the shortest carry. Beware also that the shipping lanes in the estuary hereabouts are tight into this side.  They run strongest immediately off the headland just NW the beach, on which is perched Duncannon Fort.  This means the really big boats pass very close by, and the flow is strongest just offshore.  With wind over, it can fairly kick up. <strong>Duncannon</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
