The bridge spans to and from Rocky Island.  The road bisects the island.  Rocky received planning permission for use as a crematorium in late 2006.  The crematorium will be W of the road and parking E. High rocky and fortified, the summit is a big tent shaped rock in the middle.  Its triple ramparts and central citadel were a gunpowder store from 1808.  The outer trenches were lit by candles recessed into hollows in the wall for safety.  Unoccupied 1920s to 1964, Irish Steel built the bridge when it took over, and it was storage until 2001. Rocky is always landable because the bridge supports give shelter, especially on the landward Ringaskiddy side where the rocks are shelving.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
