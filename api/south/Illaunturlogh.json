Appearing unapproachable from afar, there are in fact numerous landing opportunities, the ease or difficulty of which varies hugely with tide height and conditions.  More difficult at higher water levels, landings are not impossible at HWS, but certainly very difficult with any swell and probably not worth the effort.  At LW the easiest by far of the landings in onto the beach just NW and under the summit, formed when the gap with the islet Minnaun closes out to make a NW facing horseshoe.  Even at HW when this whole configuration disappears, there is a little cut at the back of the beach onto a narrow stormbeach, just below the summit.  There are a thousand cuts or narrow slots yielding landings to N &amp; S at almost any time onto this most fragmented islet.  The ground is very sharp and abrasive limestone rock, so the nearer to the summit the easier.  Shag and Great Black-backed Gull.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
