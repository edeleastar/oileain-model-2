As the name suggests, this attractive island is long, 5<em>km_x500_m</em>. Cattle are towed out to the island.  One boat tows another, and the towed boat has the cow attached to its stern, held fast. In more leisurely days, the cows swam the channel. Two persons live permanently on the island. Landing and camping The main landing on this inhabited island is midway along its N (sheltered, landward) side opposite the mainland, on a beach inside the pier. The main habitation is in this area. There is more holiday habitation further W. Further W again, the island is waisted N/S. On both sides of the waist, there are beaches and attractive camping sites. That on the S is less obvious as it is in a hidden and sheltered cove. Just further W of the waist, on the sheltered N side, is the wildest camping site in a cove near the W tip of the island. Water is in the houses, and may be elsewhere.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
