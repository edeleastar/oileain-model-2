The S side is a series of slanted rock slabs. Landing at the base of these slabs is from deep water. Easy access to the summit is available via a ramp from the SW corner, but landing at this point is very subject to surge and scend. It is far easier to force a landing, perhaps by swimming, further E, but from this point it is far more challenging to summit.  Certainly, a pair of rock boots, a rope and a few <em>karabiners</em> would be useful. The slabs hereabouts may not be technically difficult, but they are not safe in wet kayaking gear. There is a Herring Gull breeding colony c.35 pairs on the top and along the N side. <strong>Coulagh (Eyeries) Bay</strong> A beautiful bay of superb scenery that is all the better for being somewhat off the tourism track. Sheltered from all but strong NW winds. There are only basics available in Eyeries village. There is a choice of embarkation points. The most central is the pier 1<em>km</em> NW of the village off a sheltered storm beach at V642-514. Alternatively, there is better parking at a number of sheltered piers, the beautiful Travera Strand V617-490, Travaud V605-487, or the main pier, tucked into the NE of the bay at V654-530, one of Nimmo’s, recently modernised.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
