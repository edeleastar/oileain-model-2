The island is grassy and almost lush. Surprisingly perhaps it is grazed only by goats. There are many large holiday homes opposite on the mainland. Therefore, camping would most likely be discouraged. No water was found. Embark from a slip 200<em>m</em> to the NW of the island. Landing is directly opposite at the W end of the island onto sand or shingle. Herring Gull breed here. There is a suspicion that rodents do too.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
