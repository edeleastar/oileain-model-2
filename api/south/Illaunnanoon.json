By far the nicest of all the White Strand islands.  Only partially given to brambles and gorse.  Although the rest is long grass, the camping would definitely attract.  There is the distinct feel of island and of remoteness.  Angling would be attractive off the S side.  Purple Loose Strife abound, as well as sallies.  Land in a cut at NE.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
