It bears the signs of pedestrian traffic accessing al LWs.  The summit is at the S end.  A navigation marker at the NW side that lines up with another to the NE to clear offshore reef Carriganglee.  Attractive.  Sallies. <strong>Illaunleagh</strong> V587595           Sheet 83 / Sheet 84 This island is located in the sheltered NE corner of W Cove Harbour. At HW the island forms an attractive backwater with a sheltered bay on its landward side. The island is probably accessible at LWN and certainly so at LWS from the mainland close to its N side. Landings are easiest along the N shoreline onto gently sloping seaweed and shingle foreshore. The vegetation is composed of rough grasses, bracken and gorse. The island can be explored easily enough in winter but would probably be heavy going during the summer months.  There are a number of old stone walls surrounding a cut at the W end the purpose of which is now long lost as the island has not been grazed in many years. Water was not found and camping is not attractive. The inner bay area held Mallard, Curlew, Greenshank and Redshank in January 2012. Common Seals frequent the outer harbour area and evidence of Otter was found.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
