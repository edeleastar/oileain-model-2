Very photogenic against the backdrop of the Dingle hills, but first get the right lighting conditions. Launch from the town beach Q727-154 and pass the swimming club to the right on the way out.  Land easily onto seaweed covered slabs anywhere around the NE corner. The island is sausage shaped and the lighthouse fills almost the entire, but it is possible to walk round the edge.  The agile may perhaps manage to trespass but the walls containing the lighthouse gardens are for the most part quite high. <strong>The Mid-West</strong> <strong>Shannon Estuary to Galway City -including the Aran Islands</strong> <strong>County Kerry</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
