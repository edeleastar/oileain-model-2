The channel may dry at the lowest of spring tides. This island combines with Abbey Island to shelter Derrynane Harbour at V517-287. The harbour is used equally by working and pleasure boats, including in summer, a sailing and canoeing school at V520-584. There is a working pier at V514-592 and an abandoned fish processing plant at V508-588.  Choose your launching spot beforehand with care, as all the approach roads are twisty and narrow. Camping is possible at the outside end of the narrow channel at V516-585, with some privacy despite so many holidaymakers. The beaches are gravel and therefore uninteresting to most tourists. There is a decrepit fish-holding tank at the N end. The SW side is indented and interesting.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
