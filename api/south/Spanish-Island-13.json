It is used as a roosting spot for local bird life and apart from its beautiful backdrop of Caha Mountains has little to attract passers-by. It is surrounded by extensive rafts of Mussel farms, which dominate much of the SE inner area of Kilmakilloge Harbour. Access from Bunaw Pier at V753-599 at which there is an attractive pub / restaurant, ample parkin, and water for those on passage in the Kenmare River.  Also perhaps from a beauty spot 1<em>km</em> WNW from a pretty beach at V743-605</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
