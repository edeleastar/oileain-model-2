Hares are said to roam free on all three islands. Calf Island East is the most attractive of the three Calf islands. There is a holiday house by the deep cut into the S side. Residents may therefore appear, but unlikely perhaps. Behind the cut is a brackish lake, where grazing cows congregate. Camp at the cut. Camp elsewhere, particularly on the E side where there are many attractive little beaches backed by dunes. The most attractive of these is in the N. There is also a splendid, similar campsite on the W end of the N side. Lesser Black-backed Gull.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
