Landing is best at several small shingle beaches along N side. Grazed by cattle in 2008 and several wet flashes midway along N edge near an old ruined building suggested water available although not confirmed, and similarly a small lake in the SW. Attractive island of heather, furze and bracken, whose hidden hollows and little valleys provide interest for the walker. Camping at any of the landings. Otters and Common Seals are present on all the islands hereabouts. The channel separating Carrigdrane from Illaundrane at the latterâ€™s NE corner narrows to kayak-width at times of spring LW.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
