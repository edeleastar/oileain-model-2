Such buildings were always built of stone, which is not necessarily a weathertight arrangement.  The owners plastered the external walls top to bottom.  Whatever interaction took place between the old stone and the modern plaster, and there are many theories to be had on the subject, it is really not known how it all ended up the colour it did.  Certainly it cannot have been intentional.  At first a violent pinkish red, it has now faded in 2006 after a few years to a rusty orange. The parts of the island not covered by the castle and its ramparts have been planted with mixed forestry, and the conifers are faring better. There is road access to the island on the NE side, but kayakers will manage passage under it at all stages of the tide.  There is a pontoon arrangement by the bridge, on the island side. There is no obvious access point to this corner of the bay and certainly a quay up towards Ballydehob at W005-341 is awkward even for one car and not recommended.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
