Admire the architecture and the surroundings, and the peace, between arriving ferries.  A severe one way system governs the town traffic in that context.  The pubs and restaurants are absolutely lovely.  Kayaks will land on the S side of the harbour on a sheltered gravel beach.  Recommended stop for any visitor to the area. Across Waterford Harbour lies the beautiful fishing and tourist village of Dunmore</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
