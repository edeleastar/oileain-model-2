It is a dramatic island with major cliffs on the NW side and a distinct cockscomb shape at NE end. Landing Landing is not easy, being onto a severely sloping slab, with little shelter, on the SE side. A handrail up from the top of the slab is visible when close in. There is a sheep pen on the grass above. From further out there is a large obvious dorsal-fin shaped slab, and the landing is just SW of this. Landings may be forced elsewhere in the lee of the island, but beware of steep scrambles. Unloaded, borrowed, plastic boats are an advantage. The island features a minor monastic ruin at Q234-004, marked St. Brendan’s Oratory, on the only flat section of the island in the SW. In more recent times, it was used as a domestic dwelling. There are fields around it. It is a low-lying, drystone hovel with a smoke hole on top, and a very narrow, low entrance. There is the horrendous story of how Peig and Tomas O’Catahin became stormbound sometime after 1838.  Tomas died and Peig could remove his body, which putrified.  She resorted to hacking bits off it and throwing them out the smoke hole.  When islanders relieved her weeks later, she had become demented, but she later recovered. The island well repays the effort of landing. <strong>Coastal Section –</strong> <strong>Sybil Point to Brandon Point</strong></p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
