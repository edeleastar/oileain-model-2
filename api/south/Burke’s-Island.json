It is climbable with care on the NW or SE sides.  A lovely slot / cave twists through the SW corner.  Cormorant and gulls roost and breed on the flat summit. <strong>Annestown     X500-987        Sheet82</strong> Lovely sheltered part sandy beach just inside Brown’s Island, the beach is below and E of the town.  A height barrier at the road preventing driving into the carpark for vehicles with roof loads will cause a 150m and offputting carry for some wishinh access. <strong>Boat Strand Pier       X477-985        Sheet 82</strong> A busy working pier with a delightful beach and leisure area combined.  Very sheltered.  The parking deficit suggests small parties only. <strong>Killmurrin Cove        X466-987        Sheet 82</strong> A sheltered sandy beach with plenty of parking and a reasonable carry. <strong>Bunmahon     X432-987        Sheet 82</strong> A fine sheltered pebble beach.  Parking for a dozen cars with concrete slip at W end of town, just as the main street turns sharply up and N.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
