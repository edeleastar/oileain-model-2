The “summit” measures about the area of the feet of two average adults.  Landing may be forced only in very benign conditions, as the name probably suggests only to older kayakers.  Landing here is about as meaningful or as pointless as such landings get.  One either gets the point or one doesn’t.  This rock is nothing and nowhere on the way to nothing and nowhere, and it is miles from anywhere.  Landing surely typifies a certain spirit.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
