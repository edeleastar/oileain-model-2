Camping would therefore be very difficult as it has become very overgrown.  It has a tower, and splendid views. The landing is in Flea Sound on the N side of the island, where Basking Shark have been spotted. The arch / cave on the S side is dangerous, having access issues at each entrance, trapping the unwary in bad conditions. Black Rock W183-286 boasts an “almost” tunnel on its S side, open to the sky but not to the kayak at its closed W end.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
