Passage through the channel is only possible at times close to HW as the area dries quickly. The island is grazed and walking is attractive. Camping is good, although water was not found. Landing is best at E end of the channel onto a small stony beach at times of HW, otherwise onto rocky foreshore. Ringed Plover, Oystercatcher and Otter present.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
