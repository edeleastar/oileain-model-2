It is detached from the mainland only at HW.  Both halves of Sheep bear more arches and through caves per square metre than any other Irish island.  The view of any of its offlying stacks through one of its arches is second to none.  The island is prominent for long distances E and W.  Summiting is probably very difficult everywhere and very dangerous, the more so the inner half. Several soft landings. Kilfarassy Beach           X526-983          Sheet 76 Fine stony beach with reasonable shelter and good parking.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
