It is not quite as high or precipitous as its bigger neighbours, nor is it green on top.  In fact the summit is a large area of smooth rock shaped like a buckled deck of an aircraft carrier, every square inch painted white. Landings are possible on most sides of the island but the easiest may be in a baylet on the N side.  Access to the summit is via the SE corner. Good views all round especially towards the Old Head of Kinsale. No breeding bird species in April 2012.  Huge roosting spot September 2012.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
