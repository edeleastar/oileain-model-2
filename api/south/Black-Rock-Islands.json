The islands are small, some little more than islets but taken together merit exploration. All the islands are separated by channels or cuts and provide good kayaking interest. All landings are onto rock shelves. Four of the larger islands are further offshore than the more numerous inshore clusters. The central rocky spines of all four offshore islands run NE/SW, and all support dense colonies of lichens. The most W island, from which the group gets their name, has a large rock pool midway down the island, into which one can kayak at HW. The narrow cut which divides the two central islands of  this outer group, is just about navigable, but probably only so at HW.  It is barely the width a kayak, and one can easily access both islands by stepping across the gap. Camping Camping is just about possible on the most SE island of the larger offshore group. Two of the larger inshore group also have limited camping.  Lovely setting, no water.  The scenery, backdrop and geology of the area combine to make the area most interesting.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
