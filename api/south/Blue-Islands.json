A group of (at least) two very low lying rocky islands, with outlying reefs and islets, about 3<em>km</em> ESE of Cod’s Head.  Despite their attractive name, the islands barely manage to get their heads above water. They are not nearly as attractive as the Black Rock Islands further WNW, although they do enjoy a similar beautiful location and scenic backdrop.  Landing is onto rocky shelves at their NE ends. There are fine rock pools to explore on a good day. No camping and no water. Turnstone are present, and Oystercatcher may also breed.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
