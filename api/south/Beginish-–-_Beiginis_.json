It is indeed a small island, NE of the Great Blasket, with a ruined house.  This was last occupied by Richard O’Carroll, a cattle herdsman who tended cattle on the islands, where the grass was good.  The only problem was there was no water.  He shipped in the water in barrels every day, in fair weather or foul.  He only had to be unlucky once and eventually his luck ran out. Viking longships used to hide out in the bay between the island and <em>Oileán na nOg</em> Young’s Island to the NNE, where newly weaned lambs were put to grass. The landing place is onto a relatively sheltered, stony beach on the NW side, but also in shelter in bays on the NE and SE. Significant numbers of tern – Common, Arctic and a few Roseate.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
