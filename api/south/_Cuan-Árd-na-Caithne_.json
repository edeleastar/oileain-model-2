The harbour holds this width for almost 4 southerly <em>km</em>, and is open to the N. Shelter, depending on the wind, can be had by tucking inside either of the ‘arms’. This is very much a tourist area with villages and sandy beaches. A landing can be forced onto boulders immediately at the W end of the Sisters (about 4<em>km</em> NE of Sybil Point), but cliffs bar any ideas of making it a land escape route.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
