The island’s main interest is a small arch on the N side and good numbers of seabirds. There is a colony of Cormorants.  Herring, Lesser Black-backed and Greater Black-backed Gulls all breed. Landing is on to rock shelves along the more sheltered N / E sides. Camping possible but is not very attractive. No water found.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
