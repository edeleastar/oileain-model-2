The other sides are rocky. The island is connected to Illauntannig by a bar/reef, crossable on foot at LW.  Between tides there are breakers coming through the gap, so that underwater obstructions are a real danger. No water. There is a 3-sided, 1m high sheep shelter on top.  Also in 2009 there is some sort of nest-box experimentation, possibly for terns.  Ringed Plover and Dunlin.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
