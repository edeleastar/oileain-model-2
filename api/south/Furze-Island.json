Though it has not as of 2012 been recently grazed, walking is still good for much of island. Perhaps it is named for an area of gorse along the NE side, that makes for tough going. Almost as large as Carbery, one may camp almost anywhere. The craggy and indented southern coast is attractive kayaking. Land at the NE tip onto shingle and boulder. Cows need water so water there must be, but none has been found, yet. Many seals off the NE. In 2012 there was a small colony of Shags along S crags, 1 pair Chough, Otter, Grey Seals.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
