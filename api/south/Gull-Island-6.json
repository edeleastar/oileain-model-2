The sides are steep but not of any serious gradient. Landing is in a small cut on the NE corner onto slippery kelp covered rocks at LW.  Progress to the summit lies along an obvious fault line. Grassy on top with lots of evidence of breeding Gulls.  A Cormorant colony of c.40 pairs on SW and W sides. The S / SW / W are steep and rocky.  Several            Sheet 82 smaller sea stacks and rocky outliers lieing off the S side allow for playful passage through the channels. Purely a way-stop for the curious as the beaches hereabouts are much easier of landing. No water. Good panorama of the coast from the summit. <strong>Stradbally Cove  X371-970    Sheet 82</strong> Lying below the town, there is good parking and very sheltered launching, though a long carry at LW.  Local paddlers suggest this is only an escape option in the event of big surf. <strong>Ballyvoyle Head X347-947    Sheet 82</strong> Has a “very” small rocky island at the tip of the headland. Of particular interest is the multiple arches and caves under the headland itself.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
