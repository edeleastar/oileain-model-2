Launch from nearby Rossdohan Pier V718-637, which is the nearest to which most mortals will approach this haven.  Although in multiple ownership, these are powerful and private persons.  One might land and camp at the lovely sandy spit opposite the pier, with great views, but for the need for permission. Under the access bridge runs a beautifull tidal creek, accessible by kayak at even very LW.  The area to the S is the more remote, with seals galore.  There is a boathouse at V714-629, and a ruined mansion at V714-627.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
