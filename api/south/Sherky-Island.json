Some decrepit houses are being overrun by sheep. No roads. Land at the NE under a prominent house inside the remains of a pier, which was clearly built by Ozymandias, and not by Nimmo.  <em>“I am Ozymandias, king of kings. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.”</em>  Percy Bysshe Shelley There are storm beaches midway along the NE side and at the NE end of the SE side. In 2006 there had been recent planting of native trees around the ruined houses. The island is worth a walk especially down to SW end where rocky cliffs and geos are attractive. The island is not grazed and is tough going without good footwear.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
