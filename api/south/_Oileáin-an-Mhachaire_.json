Nearby Lough Gill is well known as the stronghold in Ireland of the Natterjack Toad. Named for being a frog that “walks” and doesn’t hop, it comes out mostly at night and has a yellow line down its back.  The islands lie on the northern side of the Dingle Peninsula, off Rough Point at the end of the isthmus that divides Brandon Bay from Tralee Bay. The underlying rock is limestone.  Basking Shark and Blue Shark are reputed to be common in these waters in the summer months. The area teems with bird and other wildlife. In Irish, the islands are called <em>Oileáin an Mhachaire</em>. Machair is a coastal feature inside an exposed sandy beach consisting of a raised dune system that has been flattened by grazing. Grazing and wind combine to create and maintain a flat grassy area. There are no raised dunes or the dunes are relatively insignificant to the overall feature. Machair is much loved by birds, (who call it a ‘roost’), by sheep (who call it a ‘meal’), by golfers (who call it a ‘links’), and by tourists (who call it a ‘campsite’). Certainly, its well-drained, short grass is excellent for camping. Once heavily grazed, nowadays its features are orientated more towards leisure pursuits, caravan parks and football pitches. Machairs are most common in the NW of Ireland between about Galway Bay and Malin Head. Embarkation Embarkation is from Scraggane Pier (by Nimmo) at Q613-196 just inside the W point of Scraggane Bay. There is a wide, gradually sloping slipway, with good parking, water, and toilets.  A new slipway to accommodate recreational use has been constructed nearby, and incerased parking has been provided between the two slips. There are also ample paying campsites generally in the area. A pub and shops can be found at Fahamore, 1<em>km</em> to the SW.  The whole Castlegregory peninsula is a thriving mix of varied holiday making.  There are endless campsites, houses, schools for diving, windsurfing and all forms of watersport.  The area has undergone massive development this millennium.  Wild camping is discouraged in high season. Tides The sound is not deep and can cut up rough, usually when a westerly wind or big swells are against the ebb tide.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Magharees</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:05 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2-3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">1:20 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2-3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The tide also sweeps strongly through and to the north of the islands.
