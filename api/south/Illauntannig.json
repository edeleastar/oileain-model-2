It boasts a summer home with outhouses, just in from the beach. It has plastic windows, double glazing, and its own private water collection system. Landing is easy at the steep, sandy beach on the E side, or elsewhere for those who like to scratch and scrape. Camping is most convenient at the landing beach, where shelter can be had behind walls. It is possible to camp almost anywhere else that a landing is made. The W side is the most exposed. The 6c monastic site reputedly founded by Senach just S of the beach has stone huts and oratories (note, no cement, just corballing at its best) surrounded by a protective stone wall. The complex includes a well-preserved <em>souterrain</em> about 10m in length, leading from a central hut to beyond the outside wall. The most notable feature of the monastery is the sandstone cross which undoubtedly once stood upon the roof of the main oratory.  The <em>bullaun</em> or prayer stone at its foot is in very good condition. The island is generally quite flat. In April 2010 there were Purple Sandpiper 40, Oystercatcher 50, Curlew 60, Turnstone 60, Sanderling 50, Merlin 1.  At other times there were numerous Oyster Catcher and Tern (mostly Arctic) nest.
