There are two former dwellings, the lower of which is being restored. The island is high to its SW. The W and S sides of the island are cliffy and give a bouncy circumnavigation under most circumstances. The E side has some intertidal beaches in coves. At least one of these is so obscured as to give a smuggler or piratical feeling. Sea urchins. Landing and Camping Land at a mud beach on N side. Behind the upper dwelling, there is a well with good water beside a wall. Camping at beach.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
