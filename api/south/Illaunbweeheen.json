The seaward N half is a strip of pleasant grass, grazed by sheep, perfectly suitable for camping.  The landward S side is covered in ferns for the most part, but maybe the sheep will make a difference.  No soft landings were found but shelves on the lqandward side are perfectly adequate.  The inner two islets are not so inviting and are un-named on the OS. Access Embarkation is best from Cuas Quay 2.5<em>km</em> ENE at V686-572 named for the beautiful cave system Coosmore 200m NW.  Road access to Cleanderry Harbour is awesomely steep and there is little or no parking at the rugged working area below, and a mussel fishery dominates Cleanderry. Cuas on the other hand is much more easy of road access, the working quay is much less stressed by use, and parking is fine.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
