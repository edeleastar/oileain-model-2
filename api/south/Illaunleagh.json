Land onto boulders in the NE-facing cove on the N side. Long grass and even longer ferns mar this once-grazed island. Camping just about possible, but no water. Panoramic. The most westerly of the group. Nice enough. Carrigavunig at V676-625 is a useful waymark en route to the island. Just a rock.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
