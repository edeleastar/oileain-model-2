Deep water separates the island from the nearby mainland near Portmagee on its S side at even the lowest spring tides. This is an early church site, and the burial place of “children and adult strangers”. There have been comprehensive “digs” and some re-building by overseas research groups.  A church and other monuments have been lovingly restored and the whole is well kept and regularly maintained. There is a stone-lined, spring-fed, holy well on the S side. A few steps lead down to it, and it has a large stone lintel for a roof. Water quality is questionable, due to lack of use. Launch from a choice of spots.  There is a carpark at Portmagee bridge.  Parking is difficult at the W end of Portmagee and not recommended.  There are a choice of slipways on the Valencia side, the best option really if a group is involved.  Land at a shingle beach on the E side.  Seals.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
