It is quite a big island and dominates the approaches to Durrus at the head of the bay. Extensive mussel and possibly oyster farms are located SE of the island. The island is thickly vegetated at its E end but walking is possible along the coastal edges and much easier on its W end. There was an attractive display of early spring flowers in April 2012 and much evidence of Otters. The views all round are good and merit a landing. Landing is onto small rocky beach on the E end. Camping is possible but not very attractive. No water found.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
