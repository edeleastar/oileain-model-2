The island is narrow, grassy topped, and is in a lovely location, with good views along a beautiful stretch of coast.  The deep water landing is onto easy rock shelves. The S side rock architecture is attractive. Gulls do not breed, despite that the habitat is very suitable, but the island is certainly an occasional roost.  A possible holt for a four footed creature the puzzle.  Certainly there is enough brackish water for the like. No drinking water was found, but camping is available, attractive even. Those paddling between Allihies and Eyeries Bays will notice that there is a hidden valley between the two.  Unnamed, it is accessible by road, though private.  This valley is famous as the set for the film “Falling for a Dancer”, chosen by Neal Jordan not only for its splendid scenery, but its complete lack of electricity or telephone poles.  The film gave the actor Colin Farrell his first great exposure.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
