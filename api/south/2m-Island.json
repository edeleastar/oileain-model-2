This island only becomes obvious to kayakers intent on exploring the inner/W harbour area.  The footprint of the island is however substantial enough. The island is long and narrow and has a wild and unkempt nature. The main island has several small satellite islets lying W of the main island that dry out at LW and complicate the geography for those curious enough to explore. All have typical inshore muddy and seaweed rich landings areas The main island is heavily vegetated with banks of furze, marshes, bramble and bracken.  Landings are possible at many points. Camping is not attractive and water was not found. The whole area is quite good for birdlife especially for wading species like Curlew, Redshank, Greenshank, Turnstone and Little Egret. Evidence of Otter also found.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
