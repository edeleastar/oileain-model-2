Coming from the NW (Schull) direction, there is a prominent wall, a slab, and some deep cuts, seen along the N side. The W end of the waist is not at all obvious, but is to be found at about the position of the wall. Here a sheltered pebble beach leads onto a rough long  grass campsite. A landing may be had also at the slab, in a deep cut, typical of this island. On the E side of the waist, opposite Skeam East, is another sheltered pebble beach, below refurbished, stone holiday houses. Here water perhaps may be had in summer. The island is ungrazed and so is unattractive to most passing campers. Tides flood generally E and S around the island, the ebb reversing the process. There is the ruin of a church.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
