It is now the prettiest of Irish villages, made famous by the best known work of Irish novelist Maeve Binchy – “Echoes”.  The seafood is excellent in all the restaurants, and all facilities are available in this modern town, but which becomes busy in the holiday season. The working pier is always on the go, and is mostly to be avoided by passing boats.  The only reliable landing spot for leisure craft is at the leisure slipway deep in the inner harbour beside the yacht club and outdoor centre.  Good parking.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
