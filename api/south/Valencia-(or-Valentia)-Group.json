Also included is a guide to the coastline from Puffin Island in the SW to Rossbeigh in the NE. Embarkation The embarkation place for the south-westerly islands of the group is at Portmagee. Launching is difficult enough, being over weedy flats. This is achieved from the car park at the bridge, from the pier, or further down Portmagee village. The village is a cul-de-sac, which incorporates pubs, restaurants, and a simple grocery shop. The ‘Skellig Experience Interpretive Centre’ (reputedly well worth the visit) is on the island side of the bridge. Ferries go from Portmagee to Skellig.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
