A smaller version of and separated from Bridaun and Inishfarnard by narrow cuts which are attractive and interesting. Landing is onto rock shelves easiest on S side, from where an easy accent to the summit. Marvellous views from this and other islands in this group. Camping is quite possible although a bit of a scramble with gear, and there are better sites available on Inishfarnard. No water found. In March 2008 there were 60 Turnstone, 45 Oystercatcher, 5 Curlew, and 2 Red Throated Diver. Shags breed in some of the cuts/caves on both islands.  A heavy suspicion of rodent on both islands.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
