Geranes West and Middle also boast Grey Seal, but given their heights above HW, all breeding is probably done on Gerane East.  In July 2008 there were several pups, so care is needed not to distress or disrupt.  Shag also breed.  Pleasant.  Great viewpoint for “the jetty” to the NE.  Land easily onto shelves on the SE side. The man-built now-redundant concrete offshore oil-landing facility (known colloquially as “the jetty”) 488m in length, looks like a scene from a post-Holocaust movie, having been destroyed by fire and expolsion in 1979. In the 1960s it was built to very future-proof specifications, being capable of accommodating vessels of up to 500,000 metric tons of deadweight (DWT), although no such vessels existed anywhere in the world when it was built.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
