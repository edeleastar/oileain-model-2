Sheep grazed, the grass is short, and there is room for half a dozen tents in a sheltered wee hollow in the centre.  Reefs jut out westwards in a manner that is highly efficient in catching driftwood.  Land at a beach / cove on the S side.  Attached on the E side to the mainland at LW via another unnamed islet.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
