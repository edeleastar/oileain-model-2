The result is a challenging landing and launching as both wave sets collide and run hard across each other.  Landing elsewhere is rocky. Doonagaun is passed on the way out to Illauntannig. No water. A reef that stretches to the WSW, to Illaunoon and onwards to the shore, commends respect, a trap for the unwary kayaker just out from the pier and heading westwards, to explore the group or otherwise.  The shallow ground to the S near the mainland shore is actually walkable at LW. Navigate with care.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
