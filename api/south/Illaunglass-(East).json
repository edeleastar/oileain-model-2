The channel is navigable at most stages of the tide but suspicion that it may be problematic at times of LWS. The island is ungrazed but is still quite a pleasant way stop for kayakers as the views both east and west are attractive. Camping is possible but no water found. Landing is onto rock ledges at the eastern end of the narrow channel. Launch from the nearby quay and slipway at Kilcrohane V825-371 Otter present.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
