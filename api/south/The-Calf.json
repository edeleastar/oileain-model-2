This prime piece of property was once owned by Her Majesty Queen Victoria. There is a red iron pillar on the Calf, the stub of a lighthouse destroyed in 1881. A very difficult landing has been forced on the N side. Securing the boats is awkward.  The effort is justified.  Marvel at the many sets of steps cut into the rock.  Enter and climb (with difficulty) the stub of the lighthouse.  Note the sheds/workshops fully roofed and set into natural breaks in the rock ridges. This must be the finest example of using natural contours and gaps to avoid exposure to wave action and blending in to the point of having the structures almost invisible.  Spending an overnight here will stay in the memory for all the right reasons. The Heifer has also been landed on. Two paddlers swam ashore (with difficulty) while a third stood-by with the boats. <strong>Allihies Bay</strong> A truly beautiful place. Stony mountains of remote and rugged appearance back the bay. The village has little more than basic facilities. The main strand and pier at V573-443 below the town is backed by grass, and has a paying campsite. There is a magnificent, sheltered strand at the pier and slip at White Strand Quay in the extreme SW of the bay, at V523-428, where campervans are discouraged.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
