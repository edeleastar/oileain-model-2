The Downhill Hotel was closed and demolished.  An apartment block now fills the gap.  Parking and toilets are beside the apartments and access is by a stream through an archway under the railway. This spot is popular with anglers. The rocky area to the E of the prominent Mussenden Temple at C758-363 is loose basalt, eroded to provide caves and arches. Fulmar and Kittiwake thrive on the sewerage outfall. There is good access and parking at Castlerock village itself at C766-365, where there is parking and toilets at the beach access point. <strong>County Antrim</strong> Tidal overview On the north coast, the tide generally turns west at Belfast HW and east at Belfast LW. The tides are complex, particularly around Rathlin and should be studied carefully. Tides flow strongly at the headlands but there are usable eddies between.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North East**"}
