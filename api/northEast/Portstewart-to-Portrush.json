Rinagree Point at C833-397 is the halfway point. To its W is Black Rock and just off it lies Lawsonâ€™s Rock, which breaks even in a moderate swell. It is possible to shelter in the lee of Black Rock. There is a tiny storm beach accessible from landward just E of Rinagree Point. Boomers may be expected hereabouts. Rock hopping and narrow channels are best enjoyed in calmer conditions and at about HW. Tides An eddy runs west on the flood tide between Ramore Head to the Bann Barmouth from 2 hours before Belfast HW.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The North East**"}
